# Xente-Fraud-Detection-Zindi-Project

This challenge was hosted on Zindi Africa.

### Challenges Faced-

• Highly imbalanced data

• Feature Selection

• Improvising F1 Score

• Other competetive logics

### Techniques and algorithms tried to approach the problem-

• Random forest Algorithm

• Feed Forward Neural Networks

• SMOTE

• Neural Autoencoders

• Support Vector Classifier

• Exploratory Data Analysis

• Interactive Visualizations


### Frameworks used-

• Keras (Tensorflow)

• Sklearn (Scikit learn)

• Pandas

• Matplotlib

• Seaborn

• Plotly 

• Numpy

### Finally the best method was to use either DNNs or SVM Classifer (rbf)

#### Note- At the time of creation of repo, the competeion was over but private leaderboard was still active. Also all models are acting as base models to give a start.
