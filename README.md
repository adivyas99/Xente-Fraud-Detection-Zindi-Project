# Xente-Fraud-Detection-Zindi-Project

This challenge was hosted on Zindi Africa.

### Challenges Faced-

‚Ä¢ Highly imbalanced data

‚Ä¢ Feature Selection

‚Ä¢ Improvising F1 Score

‚Ä¢ Other competetive logics

### Techniques and algorithms tried to approach the problem-

‚Ä¢ Random forest Algorithm

‚Ä¢ Feed Forward Neural Networks

‚Ä¢ SMOTE

‚Ä¢ Neural Autoencoders

‚Ä¢ Support Vector Classifier

‚Ä¢ Exploratory Data Analysis

‚Ä¢ Interactive Visualizations

‚Ä¢ XGBoost Classifier (Not effective)

‚Ä¢ Logistic Regression (Not that effective)

### Frameworks or Packages used-

‚Ä¢ Keras (Tensorflow)

‚Ä¢ Sklearn (Scikit learn)

‚Ä¢ Pandas

‚Ä¢ Matplotlib

‚Ä¢ Seaborn

‚Ä¢ Plotly 

‚Ä¢ Numpy

‚Ä¢ Imblearn


### Finally the best method was to use either DNNs or SVM Classifer (rbf)

#### Note- At the time of creation of repo, the competeion was over but private leaderboard was still active. Also all models are acting as base models to give a start.
